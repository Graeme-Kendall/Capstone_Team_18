Rev1:
Teachnig Tech Version
Worked without bed attached, pop and now it won't connect to pc, shows Maxtemp bed error

Rev2:
Rebuilt Rev1, no changes

Rev3
Added to HAL.h:
// Ignore temp readings during develepment.
#define BOGUS_TEMPERATURE_FAILSAFE_OVERRIDE

Still gives maxtemp bed error

Rev4:
Removed previous change
Set maxtemp to 1000

Reads extruder correctly, bed wrong
Suspect our bed is destroying thermistor ports

Rev5:
Changed thermistors to ender 3 values
Tested in ender 3 using E0 and E1 inputs
GREAT SUCCESS

Rev6:
Added Servo Functionality
Uncommented NUM_SERVOS, changed 3 to 1

Rev7:
NUM_SERVOS Changed 1 back to 3, changed delay to {300, 300, 300}
Want to see which index actually controls the servo in marlin
SUCCESS
Must use M280 P0 S(angle)

Rev 8:
Added bed, using TH1 port instead of TB
Set temp 1 pin to P0_23_A0, temp 0 to P0_24_A1, temp bed to P0_25_A2
Changed back to 1 extruder
Changed temp sensor 0 from 1 to 5
Changes temp sensor 1 from 1 to 0
Changed temp sensor bed from 0 to 1
SUCCESS

Rev 9:
Add spindle control through E1 output
Changed FAN1_PIN to P2_04
M106 P0 S255

Rev 10:
Temporarily set dummy hotend temp to test extruder
Reset max temps

Rev 11:
Removed dummy thermistor
FIRST STABLE VERSION
Still needs machine dimensions

Rev 12:
Set machine dimensions:
// The size of the print bed
#define X_BED_SIZE 235
#define Y_BED_SIZE 180

// Travel limits (mm) after homing, corresponding to endstop positions.
#define X_MIN_POS -32
#define Y_MIN_POS 0
#define Z_MIN_POS 0
#define X_MAX_POS 267
#define Y_MAX_POS Y_BED_SIZE
#define Z_MAX_POS 45

Set Steps Per Unit:
#define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT   { 800, 800, 800, 415}

Set Extruder 0 direction to invert - false:
#define INVERT_E0_DIR false

Set invert z axis to true:
#define INVERT_Z_DIR true

DIRECTIONS WRONG FOR ALL AXES, EXTRUDER UNKNOWN

Rev 13:
Inverted all axes
// Invert the stepper direction. Change (or reverse the motor connector) if an axis goes the wrong way.
#define INVERT_X_DIR false
#define INVERT_Y_DIR false
#define INVERT_Z_DIR false

Rev 14:
Disabled software endstops

Rev 15:
Added custom bootscreen
Changed SD card to onboard

Rev 16:
Added custom name

Rev 17:
Changed z direction
changed microsteps per mm

Rev 18:
Changed microsteps per mm

Rev 19:
Changed X,Y Direction

Rev 20:
Changed Y direction

NOTES:
Move Servos: 		M280 P0 S(Angle) - the range is 0 to 180 degrees
Control Spindle: 	M106 P0 S(Power) - power can be anything form 0 (off) to 255 (24V)

I've tested:
	All axes in CL mode
	Extruder open loop
	Bed heating
	Bed temperature reading
	Extruder heating
	Extruder temperature reading
	Fan output
	Spindle output
	Servo motion
